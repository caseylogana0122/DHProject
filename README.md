This project seeks to create tidy data out of a census document from the Mormon Colonies of Mexico from 1898-1903. The .py files correspond to their same-named colony data
and will create pie charts using matplotlib.

The overall reasearch question is as follows: How many single women appear throughout the colonies? This question seeks to investigate how Mormon women in the colonies inscribed
themselves in the civil record as single while still participating in polygamous unions.
