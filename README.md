This project seeks to create tidy data out of a census document from the Mormon Colonies of Mexico from 1898-1903. The .py files correspond to their same-named colony data
and will create pie charts using matplotlib.

The overall reasearch question is as follows: How many single women appear throughout the colonies? This question seeks to investigate how Mormon women in the colonies inscribed
themselves in the civil record as single while still participating in polygamous unions. 

In total, there are seven CSV files, seven python files that read and generate pie charts for their corresponding colony, three python files that computationally analyze all seven CSV files, two CSV files that are generated lists from two of the computational scripts, and finally, one Jupyter notebook that takes the user through the main computational file (computation.py) looking at the presence of single women throughout the colonies.
